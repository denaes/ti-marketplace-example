## Overview

Documentation drift is the silent killer of developer productivity. When docs say one thing and code does another, teams waste hours debugging misunderstandings, onboarding slows to a crawl, and API consumers hit walls that should never exist.

This skill provides four Python CLI tools that work together to detect, measure, classify, and report documentation drift. Unlike basic file-date comparisons, these tools perform semantic analysis: mapping code directories to their documentation, extracting function signatures to compare against API docs, validating every link and anchor, and scoring freshness on a weighted 0-100 scale.

**What sets this apart:**

- **Code-to-doc mapping** -- automatically discovers which docs describe which code directories
- **AST-based API validation** -- parses Python source with the `ast` module to compare real signatures against documented ones
- **Weighted staleness scoring** -- five dimensions scored independently, then combined with configurable weights
- **Drift classification** -- categorizes every issue as structural, factual, referential, temporal, or semantic
- **Auto-fix triage** -- tells you which issues can be fixed automatically vs. which need human judgment
- **CI/CD ready** -- exit codes, JSON output, and threshold flags for pipeline integration

**Standard library only.** No pip installs. No ML calls. No network requests (except optional URL validation). Drop the scripts into any Python 3.8+ environment and run.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full Drift Analysis

Scan all documentation against code changes since each doc was last updated. This is the primary entry point for understanding the overall drift state of a repository.

```bash
# Basic analysis
python scripts/drift_analyzer.py /path/to/repo

# Analyze with custom doc patterns
python scripts/drift_analyzer.py /path/to/repo --doc-patterns "*.md,*.rst,*.txt"

# JSON output for tooling
python scripts/drift_analyzer.py /path/to/repo --json

# Only show high-severity drift
python scripts/drift_analyzer.py /path/to/repo --min-severity high

# Analyze specific directory
python scripts/drift_analyzer.py /path/to/repo --scope src/
```

**What it does:**

1. Discovers all documentation files in the repo
2. For each doc, identifies the code directories it describes (via path proximity and content references)
3. Compares the doc's last-modified date against the git history of its associated code
4. Identifies specific changes (renamed files, moved directories, changed function signatures)
5. Classifies each drift instance by category and severity
6. Generates an actionable report with specific file:line references

**Output example:**

```
Documentation Drift Report
==========================
Repository: /path/to/repo
Scan date:  2026-03-18
Docs found: 12
Drifted:    5

HIGH SEVERITY:
  docs/api.md (last updated: 2026-01-15)
    - 23 code files changed since doc update
    - 4 functions renamed in src/handlers/
    - 2 new modules undocumented
    Category: Factual + Structural
    Recommendation: Manual update required

MEDIUM SEVERITY:
  README.md (last updated: 2026-02-28)
    - Installation section references removed dependency
    - Version string outdated (says 1.8.0, current 2.0.0)
    Category: Factual + Temporal
    Recommendation: Auto-fixable (version), Manual (installation)
```

### Workflow 2: API Documentation Validation

Check that API documentation accurately reflects the actual function signatures, class definitions, and module structure in your Python source code.

```bash
# Validate API docs against source
python scripts/api_doc_validator.py /path/to/src /path/to/docs/api.md

# Scan entire docs directory
python scripts/api_doc_validator.py /path/to/src /path/to/docs/ --recursive

# JSON output
python scripts/api_doc_validator.py /path/to/src /path/to/docs/api.md --json

# Include private methods in validation
python scripts/api_doc_validator.py /path/to/src /path/to/docs/ --include-private
```

**What it detects:**

- Functions/classes present in code but missing from docs
- Functions/classes documented but no longer in code (removed or renamed)
- Parameter mismatches (missing params, wrong types, wrong defaults)
- Deprecated items still documented as current
- Return type mismatches
- Module-level docstring drift

**How it works:**

The tool uses Python's `ast` module to parse source files and extract function signatures, class definitions, decorators, and docstrings. It then parses the markdown documentation looking for function/class references, parameter lists, and code blocks. Mismatches are reported with exact locations in both source and documentation.

### Workflow 3: README Health Check

Validate README sections against the actual project state. This combines drift analysis, link checking, and completeness scoring into a single README-focused report.

```bash
# Check README health
python scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py /path/to/repo --readme-focus

# Check with custom sections
python scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py /path/to/repo --required-sections "Installation,Usage,API,Contributing,License"
```

**Validates:**

- Required sections are present (Installation, Usage, API Reference, Contributing, License)
- Version strings match package version (package.json, setup.py, pyproject.toml)
- File references in README actually exist
- Badge URLs are well-formed
- Code examples reference existing files/functions
- Table of contents matches actual headings

### Workflow 4: Link Integrity Audit

Check every link in every markdown file -- local file references, anchors, cross-document links, and optionally external URLs.

```bash
# Check all markdown links
python scripts/link_checker.py /path/to/repo

# Include external URL checks (slower, makes HTTP requests)
python scripts/link_checker.py /path/to/repo --check-external

# Check specific file
python scripts/link_checker.py /path/to/repo/README.md

# JSON output
python scripts/link_checker.py /path/to/repo --json

# Only show broken links
python scripts/link_checker.py /path/to/repo --broken-only
```

**What it checks:**

- Local file references (`[link](path/to/file.md)`) -- does the file exist?
- Anchor references (`[link](#section-name)`) -- does the heading exist?
- Cross-document anchors (`[link](other.md#section)`) -- does the file and heading exist?
- Relative path correctness (catches `../` errors)
- Case sensitivity issues (common on Linux but silent on macOS)
- Image references -- do referenced images exist?
- Duplicate anchors that would cause ambiguous links

### Workflow 5: Continuous Doc Monitoring

Integrate documentation drift detection into your CI/CD pipeline for ongoing monitoring.

**GitHub Actions example:**

```yaml
name: Documentation Drift Check
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, dev]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  doc-drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Full history for git log analysis

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'

      - name: Run drift analysis
        run: python engineering-team/doc-drift-detector/scripts/drift_analyzer.py . --json > drift-report.json

      - name: Check staleness score
        run: python engineering-team/doc-drift-detector/scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py . --threshold 50

      - name: Validate API docs
        run: python engineering-team/doc-drift-detector/scripts/api_doc_validator.py src/ docs/api.md

      - name: Check links
        run: python engineering-team/doc-drift-detector/scripts/link_checker.py .

      - name: Upload drift report
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: drift-report
          path: drift-report.json
```

**Pre-commit hook:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
# Fail commit if docs are severely stale
python engineering-team/doc-drift-detector/scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py . --threshold 30 --quiet
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Documentation is critically stale. Update docs before committing."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Staleness Scoring

Documentation freshness is scored on a **0-100 scale** where **100 = perfectly current**. The score is a weighted combination of five dimensions:

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Last Updated** | 20% | How recently the doc file was modified relative to its associated code |
| **Code-Doc Alignment** | 30% | Whether documented items (functions, classes, files) still exist and match |
| **Link Health** | 15% | Percentage of links that resolve correctly |
| **Completeness** | 20% | Whether expected sections are present and non-empty |
| **Accuracy** | 15% | Whether version strings, file paths, and other verifiable facts are correct |

**Score interpretation:**

| Score | Label | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 90-100 | Excellent | No action needed |
| 70-89 | Good | Minor updates recommended |
| 50-69 | Stale | Updates needed before next release |
| 30-49 | Critical | Immediate attention required |
| 0-29 | Abandoned | Full rewrite likely needed |

**Customization:**

```bash
# Override default weights
python scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py /path/to/repo \
  --weight-updated 0.25 \
  --weight-alignment 0.25 \
  --weight-links 0.15 \
  --weight-completeness 0.20 \
  --weight-accuracy 0.15

# Set staleness thresholds
python scripts/doc_staleness_scorer.py /path/to/repo --threshold 60
```

## Drift Categories

Every detected drift instance is classified into one or more categories:

### Structural Drift
Missing or misorganized sections. A README lacks an Installation section. An API doc is missing an entire module. A CHANGELOG has no entries for the latest version.

**Detection:** Compare actual document headings against expected headings for that document type.

### Factual Drift
Incorrect information. A function signature in the docs has the wrong parameters. An installation command references a removed package. A configuration example uses deprecated options.

**Detection:** Cross-reference documented facts against code analysis (AST parsing, file existence, git tags).

### Referential Drift
Broken references. A link points to a file that was moved. An anchor references a heading that was renamed. An image path is wrong.

**Detection:** Link checker validates every reference against the filesystem and document structure.

### Temporal Drift
Outdated time-sensitive content. Version strings are old. "Last updated" dates are stale. "Coming soon" items that shipped months ago. Roadmap items past their target date.

**Detection:** Extract version strings and dates, compare against git tags, package manifests, and current date.

### Semantic Drift
Technically accurate but misleading. A description says "simple REST API" when the project now has GraphQL, gRPC, and WebSocket endpoints. The architecture overview omits a major new subsystem.

**Detection:** Compare document topic coverage against code directory structure and file counts. Flag when code complexity has grown significantly but documentation scope has not.

---

## Auto-Fix vs Manual-Fix Classification

Not all drift can be fixed programmatically. The tools classify each issue:

### Auto-Fixable (safe to automate)

- **Version string updates** -- replace old version with current from package manifest
- **Date updates** -- update "last modified" timestamps
- **Broken local links** -- suggest correct path when file was moved (git log tracks renames)
- **Missing table of contents entries** -- generate from actual headings
- **Removed file references** -- flag for deletion or suggest replacement

### Manual-Fix Required (needs human judgment)

- **Architectural description changes** -- requires understanding intent
- **API usage examples** -- new examples need domain context
- **Migration guides** -- require understanding of breaking changes
- **Getting started rewrites** -- narrative flow needs human touch
- **Security documentation updates** -- compliance implications require review

### Semi-Automated (template + human review)

- **New function documentation** -- generate skeleton from AST, human fills description
- **Changelog entries** -- generate from git commits, human edits for clarity
- **README section additions** -- provide template, human adds content

The drift report marks each issue with `[AUTO]`, `[MANUAL]`, or `[SEMI]` tags.

## Integration Points

### With CI/CD Pipelines

All tools return non-zero exit codes when issues are found:
- Exit 0: No issues (or all within threshold)
- Exit 1: Issues found exceeding threshold
- Exit 2: Tool error (invalid arguments, missing files)

### With Code Review

Add drift analysis to PR checks. When a PR modifies code in `src/`, automatically check whether docs in `docs/` need updates. The drift analyzer can scope its analysis to only changed directories.

### With Documentation Generators

Pair with tools like Sphinx, MkDocs, or mdBook. Run API validation after doc generation to ensure the generated docs match source. Run link checker on the built output.

### With Release Processes

Add staleness scoring to release checklists. Block releases if documentation score falls below threshold. Generate drift reports as release artifacts.

### With Other Skills

- **code-reviewer** -- include doc drift in PR review reports
- **senior-devops** -- integrate into deployment pipelines
- **senior-qa** -- documentation quality as part of QA checklist
