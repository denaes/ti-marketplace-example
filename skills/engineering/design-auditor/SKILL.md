## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run a full design audit (produces 3 grades)
# Prepare audit findings as JSON, then score:
python scripts/design_scorer.py --input findings.json --output report.json

# 2. Detect AI-generated slop in HTML/CSS
python scripts/ai_slop_detector.py --input page.html --css styles.css

# 3. Check color contrast against WCAG
python scripts/color_contrast_checker.py --foreground "#333333" --background "#ffffff"
python scripts/color_contrast_checker.py --input colors.json --level AAA

# 4. Validate design system compliance
python scripts/design_system_validator.py --tokens tokens.json --input styles.css
```

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full Design Audit (12-Category Systematic Review)

Execute a top-to-bottom audit across all 12 categories plus overall coherence. Each category is scored 0-10, weighted, and aggregated into a Design Grade (A-F).

**Steps:**

1. **Preparation** — Gather all screens, components, and interaction flows. Identify the design system (if any) and target platforms.
2. **Visual Pass** — Evaluate categories 1-4: Visual Hierarchy, Typography, Color & Contrast, Spacing & Layout Grid.
3. **Interaction Pass** — Evaluate categories 5-6: Interaction States, Navigation & Information Architecture.
4. **Platform Pass** — Evaluate categories 7-8: Responsive Design, Accessibility (WCAG).
5. **Polish Pass** — Evaluate categories 9-10: Motion & Animation, Content & Microcopy.
6. **Integrity Pass** — Evaluate categories 11-12: AI Slop Indicators, Performance as Design.
7. **Coherence Assessment** — Rate overall design coherence across all categories.
8. **Scoring** — Run `design_scorer.py` to compute weighted grades.
9. **Remediation Plan** — Prioritize fixes by severity (Critical > High > Medium > Low > Cosmetic).

```bash
python scripts/design_scorer.py --input audit_findings.json --output full_report.json --verbose
```

### Workflow 2: AI Slop Detection

Identify generic, template-driven, or AI-generated UI patterns that lack intentionality and reduce design quality.

**Steps:**

1. **HTML Analysis** — Scan markup for structural slop patterns (generic hero sections, 3-column grids, cookie-cutter pricing tables).
2. **CSS Analysis** — Detect visual slop (stock gradients, excessive box-shadows, blur overuse, inconsistent spacing values).
3. **Copy Analysis** — Flag generic microcopy, vague CTAs, buzzword density, lorem ipsum residue.
4. **Confidence Scoring** — Each finding gets a confidence score (0.0-1.0) indicating how likely it is AI-generated vs intentional design.
5. **Remediation** — Provide specific suggestions for making each flagged element more intentional.

```bash
python scripts/ai_slop_detector.py --input index.html --css styles.css --threshold 0.6
```

### Workflow 3: Accessibility Compliance Check (WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA)

Systematic validation against WCAG 2.1 success criteria with automated color contrast checking.

**Steps:**

1. **Color Contrast Audit** — Run `color_contrast_checker.py` against all foreground/background combinations.
2. **Semantic Structure** — Verify heading hierarchy, landmark regions, ARIA labels.
3. **Keyboard Navigation** — Validate focus order, skip links, focus indicators.
4. **Screen Reader Compatibility** — Check alt text, form labels, live regions, error announcements.
5. **Motor Accessibility** — Verify touch target sizes (minimum 44x44px), gesture alternatives.
6. **Cognitive Accessibility** — Evaluate reading level, consistent navigation, error prevention.

```bash
python scripts/color_contrast_checker.py --input color_pairs.json --level AA --suggest-fixes
```

### Workflow 4: Design System Compliance

Validate that implementation matches the project's design token definitions.

**Steps:**

1. **Token Extraction** — Load design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, shadows, radii).
2. **CSS Scanning** — Parse stylesheets for hardcoded values that should use tokens.
3. **Deviation Detection** — Flag any value not in the token set.
4. **Compliance Scoring** — Calculate percentage of values using tokens vs hardcoded.
5. **Migration Plan** — Generate token replacement suggestions for each violation.

```bash
python scripts/design_system_validator.py --tokens design-tokens.json --input styles.css --output compliance.json
```

### Workflow 5: Responsive & Cross-Device Audit

Validate design across breakpoints and device categories.

**Steps:**

1. **Breakpoint Analysis** — Verify media query coverage (mobile: 320-480, tablet: 481-1024, desktop: 1025+).
2. **Touch Target Validation** — Ensure interactive elements meet 44x44px minimum on touch devices.
3. **Content Reflow** — Check that content reflows properly without horizontal scrolling at 320px.
4. **Image Responsiveness** — Verify srcset usage, art direction, lazy loading.
5. **Typography Scaling** — Check fluid typography or appropriate size adjustments per breakpoint.
6. **Navigation Patterns** — Validate mobile navigation patterns (hamburger, bottom nav, etc.).

## 12 Audit Categories

### 1. Visual Hierarchy & Composition (Weight: 10%)

Evaluate how effectively the design guides the user's eye through content.

- **Primary focal point** — Is there a clear visual entry point on each screen?
- **Z-pattern / F-pattern** — Does content flow match established reading patterns?
- **Size contrast** — Do important elements have sufficient size differentiation?
- **Whitespace usage** — Is negative space used intentionally to create groupings?
- **Visual weight balance** — Is the composition balanced or intentionally asymmetric?

### 2. Typography System (Weight: 8%)

Assess typographic consistency, hierarchy, and readability.

- **Type scale** — Is there a consistent modular scale (e.g., 1.25, 1.333, 1.5)?
- **Heading hierarchy** — H1 > H2 > H3 clearly differentiated in size and weight?
- **Body readability** — Line height 1.4-1.6, line length 45-75 characters?
- **Font pairing** — Maximum 2-3 font families with clear roles?
- **Responsive typography** — Font sizes adapt appropriately across breakpoints?

### 3. Color & Contrast (Weight: 8%)

Validate color system integrity and accessibility compliance.

- **Color palette** — Defined primary, secondary, neutral, semantic (error/warning/success/info)?
- **Contrast ratios** — All text meets WCAG AA minimum (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)?
- **Color independence** — Information not conveyed by color alone?
- **Dark mode** — If applicable, proper color inversion with maintained contrast?
- **Color consistency** — Same semantic meaning for same colors throughout?

### 4. Spacing & Layout Grid (Weight: 8%)

Assess spatial consistency and grid system usage.

- **Spacing scale** — Consistent spacing values (4px/8px base or similar)?
- **Grid system** — Defined column grid with consistent gutters?
- **Component spacing** — Consistent internal padding and external margins?
- **Alignment** — Elements aligned to grid or intentionally offset?
- **Density balance** — Appropriate information density for the context?

### 5. Interaction States (Weight: 10%)

Validate completeness of interactive element states.

- **Default** — Clear affordance that element is interactive
- **Hover** — Visual feedback on cursor hover (desktop)
- **Focus** — Visible focus indicator for keyboard navigation

### 9. Motion & Animation (Weight: 5%)

Assess animation quality and appropriateness.

- **Purpose** — Animations serve functional purpose (feedback, orientation, guidance)
- **Performance** — Animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)
- **Duration** — Appropriate timing (100-300ms for micro-interactions, 300-500ms for transitions)
- **Easing** — Natural easing curves, no linear animations for UI elements
- **Reduced motion** — Respects prefers-reduced-motion media query

### 10. Content & Microcopy (Weight: 5%)

- **Brand alignment** — Design reflects brand personality and values
- **Consistency** — Patterns learned in one area apply throughout
- **Polish level** — Attention to detail in edge cases and transitions

## Scoring System

### Three Independent Grades

Unlike single-grade systems, the Design Auditor produces **three separate grades** for comprehensive evaluation:

#### 1. Design Grade (A-F)

Weighted aggregate of all 12 categories plus coherence bonus.

| Grade | Score Range | Meaning |
|-------|------------|---------|
| A+ | 95-100 | Exceptional — production-ready, sets new standards |
| A | 90-94 | Excellent — minor polish items only |
| B+ | 85-89 | Very Good — few notable issues |
| B | 80-84 | Good — solid foundation with improvement areas |
| C+ | 75-79 | Adequate — functional but needs refinement |
| C | 70-74 | Below Average — multiple issues need attention |
| D | 60-69 | Poor — significant problems across categories |
| F | 0-59 | Failing — fundamental redesign needed |

#### 2. AI Slop Grade (A-F)

Based on AI Slop Indicators category (inverted — fewer slop patterns = higher grade).

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A | Highly original — no detectable AI patterns |
| B | Mostly original — 1-2 minor patterns detected |
| C | Mixed — several AI patterns present but customized |
| D | Heavily templated — many generic AI patterns |
| F | Pure slop — design appears entirely AI-generated without refinement |

#### 3. Accessibility Grade (A-F)

Based on WCAG compliance level achieved.

| Grade | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| A+ | AAA compliant — exceeds all requirements |
| A | AA compliant — meets all standard requirements |
| B | Mostly AA — 1-3 minor violations |
| C | Partial AA — several violations, core content accessible |
| D | Significant gaps — multiple barriers to access |
| F | Inaccessible — fundamental accessibility failures |

## AI Slop Detection Patterns

### Visual Slop

| Pattern | Description | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Generic hero section | Full-width hero, centered heading, subtitle, CTA over gradient/image | 0.7-0.9 |
| Stock gradient | Linear gradient with trending colors (purple-blue, pink-orange) | 0.5-0.8 |
| 3-column feature grid | Exactly 3 columns: icon + heading + paragraph | 0.6-0.8 |
| Shadow overuse | box-shadow on > 60% of card/container elements | 0.5-0.7 |
| Blur overuse | backdrop-filter: blur on multiple overlapping elements | 0.5-0.7 |
| Rounded everything | border-radius > 12px on most elements | 0.4-0.6 |

### Copy Slop

| Pattern | Description | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Vague CTAs | "Get Started", "Learn More", "Try It Free" without context | 0.5-0.7 |
| Buzzword density | "Seamless", "Powerful", "Revolutionary", "Next-gen" clustering | 0.6-0.8 |
| Generic testimonials | Vague praise without specific product/feature references | 0.6-0.8 |
| Lorem ipsum residue | Placeholder text fragments or suspiciously uniform paragraph lengths | 0.8-1.0 |

### Structural Slop

| Pattern | Description | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Template ordering | Hero > Features > Social Proof > Pricing > CTA > Footer | 0.5-0.7 |
| Cookie-cutter pricing | 3 tiers, middle highlighted, feature checkmark lists | 0.6-0.8 |
| Predictable footer | 4-column footer with Newsletter, Social, Links, Legal | 0.4-0.6 |

## Design Philosophy & Taste Anchors

These 10 principles are not optional guidelines — they are the audit's operating system. Every finding is evaluated against them.

1. **Specificity over vibes** — "Clean UI" is banned. Name the font, the spacing scale, the color system. If you cannot name it, it is not a design decision.
2. **Empty states are features** — "No items found" is a bug. Empty states guide users to their first action, explain what will appear, and build confidence.
3. **Subtraction default** — As little design as possible, but not less. Every element must earn its place. When in doubt, remove it. (Dieter Rams)
4. **Edge cases are user experiences** — 47-character names, zero search results, slow networks, stale state. These are not exceptions — they are the product for some users, every time.
5. **Four shadow paths** — For every interaction, test: happy path, nil input, empty input, error upstream. If any path produces a blank screen or unhandled state, that is a Critical finding.
6. **Loading states earn trust** — Skeleton screens > spinners > blank pages. Progressive disclosure of content signals responsiveness even before data arrives.
7. **Consistency compounds** — One off-system color erodes the entire design language. Design tokens are contracts, not suggestions. Every deviation is a finding.
8. **Motion has meaning** — Every animation must communicate state change (enter, exit, reorder, feedback). Decorative motion without purpose is noise — and noise is a finding.
9. **Accessibility is not a feature** — It is a baseline. WCAG AA is the floor, not the ceiling. Accessibility findings are never "Low" priority.
10. **Performance is perceived design** — A 3-second load feels broken regardless of visual quality. LCP, CLS, and INP are design metrics.

---

## Interaction Model & Safety Controls

### Fix Session Rules
- **One issue = one question** — never batch multiple design issues into a single prompt. Each finding is evaluated and addressed independently.
- **AUTO-FIX (no confirmation):** Cosmetic issues — spacing token mismatches, off-system colors swapped to nearest token, minor border-radius corrections
- **ASK (requires confirmation):** Structural issues — layout changes, component swaps, new patterns, navigation restructuring
- **Maximum 30 fixes per session** — hard stop. After 30 fixes, generate report and exit.
- **Risk accumulator** — component file changes (+5 risk), global style changes (+8), layout changes (+10), reverts (+15). **Stop if cumulative risk exceeds 20%** of budget (100).
- **Revert on regression** — if a fix breaks existing visual tests or introduces a new Critical finding, immediately `git revert` and flag for manual review.
